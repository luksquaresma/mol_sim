## Some initial thoughts

One of the greatest achievements of man kind is the ability control it's environment.

Think of all the beings in the planet several thousand years ago, in the begging of mankind as a species: at some point most of them were stronger, faster, or more numerous human kind. Yet we were the ones who thieved in this environments.

Tho achieve this we din't need to be any better at these qualities, we only had to outsmart our opponents. This came as direct consequence of our ability learn with the environment.

Taking a pure utilitarian point of view of an engineer, it can be clearly shown in each process our species managed to master by observation or **needs** and **resources**.

**Basic need for food**:
	1. (*Problem*)     Difficulty to survive when we could't even cut our food.
	2. (*Observation*) Sharp rock can cut flesh and wood.
	3. (*Observation*) When rocks fall from high enough they brake.
	4. (*Hypothesis*)  It's possible to break stones to make tools.

**Basic need for heat**:
	1. (*Problem*)     Climate can be cold and humid.
	2. (*Observation*) Lightning starts fire.
	3. (*Observation*) Some stones spark when falling on each other.
	4. (*Hypothesis*)  Stones can start fires.

**Basic need for shelter**:
	1. (*Problem*)     The night can be cold.
	2. (*Observation*) Broken stones can cut wood.
	3. (*Observation*) Wood is strong and light.
	4. (*Hypothesis*)  Let's make a home.

## Whats and hows:

- ***5W2H and human nature:***
	- If you want to truly understand
	- **What?** **Why?** Who? When? **How?** How much?

- ***How can we truly understand something?***
	- **What** is the nature of something?
		- **Why** it is this way?
	- **How** does this thing behave?
		- **Why** does it behave like this?

- ***How can we predict (model) the future of something?***
	- Requisites:
		1. Rough description of **what it is**.
		2. Good description of **how it interacts with the environment**.
		3. Good description of **how it changes** (interact with itself)
	- Procedure:
		1. Knowledge of the current state.
		2. Knowledge of how changed occur.
		3. we can have a pretty good idea of how it will be in the future.
		4. There are several ways to get this answers.

>***To predict the future of something we don't need to be god (all-knowing) we just need to understand enough it's iterations.***

# Preface to the following parts: Why all the following explanations?
- (***What?***)  Understand the nature of the electron and the atom.
- (***Why?***)   Understand their behavior.
- (***How?***)   Try to grasp future behavior.

## Atoms
> ***How can we understand the fundamental structures of matter?***
### The division path:
- How can we "see" the atom?
- Metal -> Particle -> Grain -> Molecule -> Atom -> Quark -> (strings etc?)
### **Metals: the first standard for studying solids and the structure of materials.**
