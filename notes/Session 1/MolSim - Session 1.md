## Some initial thoughts

One of the greatest achievements of man kind is the ability control it's environment.

Think of all the beings in the planet several thousand years ago, in the begging of mankind as a species: at some point most of them were stronger, faster, or more numerous human kind. Yet we were the ones who thieved in this environments.

Tho achieve this we din't need to be any better at these qualities, we only had to outsmart our opponents. This came as direct consequence of our ability learn with the environment.

Taking a pure utilitarian point of view of an engineer, it can be clearly shown in each process our species managed to master by observation or **needs** and **resources**.

***Basic need for food***:
	1. (*Problem*)     Difficulty to survive when we could't even cut our food.
	2. (*Observation*) Sharp rock can cut flesh and wood.
	3. (*Observation*) When rocks fall from high enough they brake.
	4. (*Hypothesis*)  It's possible to break stones to make tools.

***Basic need for heat***:
	1. (*Problem*)     Climate can be cold and humid.
	2. (*Observation*) Lightning starts fire.
	3. (*Observation*) Some stones spark when falling on each other.
	4. (*Hypothesis*)  Stones can start fires.

***Basic need for shelter***:
	1. (*Problem*)     The night can be cold.
	2. (*Observation*) Broken stones can cut wood.
	3. (*Observation*) Wood is strong and light.
	4. (*Hypothesis*)  Let's make a home.

### How to describe movement?
- Forces and acceleration
- Simplest form: Newton's second law
		![](Data/newtons_second_law.png)
		([Wikipedia: Newton's laws of motion](Data/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion))

	> Forces mediate ==interactions==, the result of interactions regarding ==movement== is ==acceleration==.

# Modeling
---
## Starting with the questions:

- **Requisites:** (==DONE==)
	1. Rough description of what it is
	2. Good description of how it interacts with the environment.
	3. Good description of how it changes (interact with itself)
- **Procedure:**
	1. Knowledge of the ==current state==.
	2. Knowledge of how ==change== occur.
	3. Inference (simulation) of the ==future state==.
		*- There are several ways to get this answers.*

### How can we represent molecules in a 3D space?
- Current state:
	- ==Position==: 3D vector (m) (Vec<Vec<f32>>)
	- ==Orientation==: 3D vector (degrees)  (Vec<Vec<f32>>)
	- ==Velocity==: 3D vector (m/s)  (Vec<Vec<f32>>)
	- ==Angular velocity==: (degrees/s)  (Vec<Vec<f32>>)
- How change occur?
	- With the environment: force fields
	- With itself:
		- Movement dynamics: newtons second law
- ==Simulation  of future state==


### What is a reasonable model for molecule simulation?
- #todo 


D = (1/C0) * 10^(-21) [C*m]
