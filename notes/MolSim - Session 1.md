- Protons, neutrons and electrons.
- Electron particle wave behavior.
	- Probability functions.
	- Measurements and the uncertainty principle.
- Iterations between atoms:
	- Example of the electrical force (Coulomb's law)
	- Other forces:
		- Gravity
		- Electromagnetic force
		- Weak force
		- Strong force
## Atomic bonds
There are three types of atomic bonds, they are:
- Ionic bond:
- Covalent bond:
- Metallic bond:
## Molecular behavior
- Stability concept
- Minimization of energy: bond length
- Activation energy example.
## Rigid sphere model
- Representations in 2D
- Representations in 3D
## Molecular orbital model
- Probability functions of the electron positions in molecules
- Molecular polarity (dipole moment)
## Interactions between molecules
- Dipole-dipole:
- van-der-Waals force:
