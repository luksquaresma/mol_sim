# MolSim - a molecular simulation tool made in rust
https://github.com/luksquaresma/mol_sim
---
## Motivation

Molecular simulations are simple examples of systems that can be computationally modeled. This project regards the design of a such model using an incremental approach. 

This is an educational project made with the intention to show all the steps in itâ€™s construction (mathematical, physicochemical and computational) and the actual implementation while learning a new programming language (Rust).
